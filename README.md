# python_jarvis
Tried to make a bot using Python Script, that would open and close the windows application and also search on the browser according to user instruction.
Internal code details:
1. In 't' we are storing all true vale response.
2. In 'f' we are storing all true vale response.
3. In 'p' we are storing all the program names.
4. In 'c' we stored command respective to each program in 'p'.
5. To search any website write the name/url of the website with 'search' prefix: 
		EX: search facebook or search facebook.com

This script is currently limited , it would do only limited task for NOW.
